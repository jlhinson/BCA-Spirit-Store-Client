## Background
I created this project for a small private school to sell school branded items to fans and help raise money for the school. This is a small React app that was written over the course of a few days. The checkout is currently just an email sent to the administrator with a list if items purchased. The buyer would then drop the money off at the school and pick up their items. This could easily be tied to a card processing system as well as allow for shipped orders.
